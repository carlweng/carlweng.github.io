  Hi, my name is Chenkai Weng. I'm a first year PhD student at [Computer Science Department](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) of [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). My interest lies in Cryptography and currently I focus on Secure Multi-Party Computation.

  I'm honored to be advised by [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiao1254.github.io/).
